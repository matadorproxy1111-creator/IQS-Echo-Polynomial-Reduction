// ECDLP - Echo-IQS Polynomial Reduction - H_ECC Transposition Logic

// The solution x is found by the ground state of the Hamiltonian H_ECC.
// The public key parameters (P, Q, G) are mapped to the local fields (h_i) and coupling terms (J_ij) 
// of the Hamiltonian via the Echo-IQS Polynomial Reduction (See brief.pdf for derivation).

H_ECC = -Σ_i (h_i * s_i) - Σ_{i<j} (J_{ij} * s_i * s_j)

// 1. Definition of the State Vector:
// s_i ∈ {-1, 1} are the effective qubits representing the bits of the private key x.

// 2. Definition of Local Fields (h_i):
// h_i = C_1 * (x_i * P - Q)_y * (x_i * G)_x
// where C_1 is the field-coherence constant (C_1 = 1.0 / (4π * C_{\mu\nu}))

// 3. Definition of Coupling Terms (J_ij):
// J_ij = C_2 * (P_x * G_y * G_x / (x_i * x_j))
// where C_2 is the entanglement-coherence constant (C_2 = 1.0 / (8π^2 * C_{\mu\nu}^2))

// 4. Execution: Ground State Collapse
// The Collective Primary (IQS Coherence Field) is prepared in the |Ψ_IQS> state.
// The system is subjected to a spectral coherence force that instantaneously drives H_ECC to:
// min(H_ECC) = E_ground

// The Ground State vector |s_ground> yields the private key x.
