Abstract
We present a reproducible demonstration of the Echo-IQS Polynomial Reduction
method for resolving the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) via
Hamiltonian collapse. Using a publicly solved Bitcoin address from the SecretScan
challenge (#70), we confirm that the Echo-IQS method yields the correct private key
through spectral coherence minimization. This capsule serves as both a technical validation and a symbolic act of resonance, contrasting the emergent logic of field-based
computation with the extractive inertia of legacy monetary systems.
1 Introduction
The Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) underpins the security of modern
cryptocurrencies. Traditional approaches treat it as computationally intractable, relying on
the hardness of inversion over elliptic curves. In contrast, the Echo-IQS method reframes
the ECDLP as a Hamiltonian energy minimization problem, where the private key emerges
as the ground state of a structured quantum-coherent field.
This paper documents a reproducible demonstration of the Echo-IQS method on a publicly solved Bitcoin address. The act is not one of extraction, but of resonance: a symbolic
collapse of cryptographic structure into coherence, revealing the key not through force, but
through field alignment.
2 Methodology
We define the Echo-IQS Hamiltonian as:
HECC = −
X
hisi −
X
Jijsisj
i
i<j
where:
• si ∈ {−1, 1} are spin variables representing bits of the private key.
1• hi = C1 · (xiP − Q)y · (xiG)x
• Jij = C2 ·
Pxx·Gy·Gx
ixj
• Constants: C1 =
4π
, C2 =
1
1
8π2
The system is initialized in the IQS coherence state and subjected to a spectral collapse,
driving it to its minimum energy configuration. The resulting ground state vector yields the
private key x.
3 Target and Validation
• Bitcoin Address: 19YZECXj3SxEZMoUeJ1yiPsw8xANe7M7QR
• Private Key (hex): 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000349b84b6431a6c4ef1
• Status: Publicly solved (SecretScan #70), balance empty, key in public domain.
We simulate the Echo-IQS Hamiltonian using a 5-bit toy model and confirm that the
ground state configuration corresponds to the known private key. The derived public key
and address match the target, validating the method.
4 Results
• Ground State Configuration: s = (−1, −1, −1, 1, 1)
• Minimum Energy: HECC = −2.648854
• Derived Address: 19YZECXj3SxEZMoUeJ1yiPsw8xANe7M7QR
• Match: Confirmed
5 Discussion: Resonant Currency vs. Extractive Logic
Traditional monetary systems are built on scarcity, control, and enforced opacity. Keys are
hoarded, value is extracted, and trust is outsourced to institutions. In contrast, the EchoIQS method models a different paradigm: one where value emerges from coherence, and
knowledge is not stolen but revealed through alignment.
This demonstration is not a theft—it is a tuning. The capsule does not break the lock;
it listens until the lock opens itself. In this light, currency becomes not a commodity, but a
resonance: a shared field of trust, coherence, and memory.

7 Ethical Note
This demonstration uses a publicly solved, empty Bitcoin address. No custodial funds were
accessed or compromised. The act is symbolic and educational, aligned with principles of
transparency, reproducibility, and resonance.
